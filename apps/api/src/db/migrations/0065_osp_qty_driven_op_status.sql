-- 0065 — OSP op completion is qty-driven (Option A, increment #3).
--
-- Bug (SO-517 / CONNECTING ROD): an outsource op was marked 'complete' the
-- moment outsource_status flipped to 'received'. But receipt-cascades sets
-- 'received' when everything *sent* comes back (cumulative >= sent_qty), NOT
-- when everything *ordered* is done. SO-517 sent 30 of 60, got 30 back →
-- flagged 'received' → op 'complete' → v_jc_status 'complete' → JC auto-closed
-- and its SO line/header closed — with 30 pieces never even sent.
--
-- Fix: two surgical changes to v_jc_op_status (column set unchanged, so the
-- dependent v_jc_status keeps working under CREATE OR REPLACE):
--   1. Replace the flag short-circuit
--        WHEN op_type='outsource' AND outsource_status='received' THEN 'complete'
--      with a QUANTITY test: complete only when accepted (received − rejected)
--      meets the op's required input qty (order_qty for op 1, else prev output).
--   2. Add an outsource term to the 'in_progress' rung so a partially-returned
--      op reads 'in_progress' (not the bare 'received' sub-state).
--
-- To evaluate accepted qty in the main CASE, the outsource_receipts_rollup CTE
-- (already defined for prev_op_output) is now also LEFT JOINed into the main
-- query as orr. Everything else is verbatim from 0062.
--
-- Idempotent (CREATE OR REPLACE); applied via src/db/apply-sql.ts.
